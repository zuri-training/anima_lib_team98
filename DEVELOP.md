## Structure

Each of the library "modules" lives in a compressed zip named animax.zip. The library contains three primary files:

  - animax.css : This contains the core animations, which include pulse, bounce, move, etc.
  - animax.js : This contains the funtions that help perform DOM manipulation techniques and apply various animations to the corresponding HTML elements as input by the users.
  - animation-usage-guide.md : This provides the user with a user-friendly manual of sort that shows the ID they can use in their web projects to produce a particular animation and their variants.
