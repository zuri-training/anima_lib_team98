## Introduction

Animax is a library of ready-to-use, cross-browser animations for use in your web projects. Suitable for emphasis, home pages, sliders, attention-guiding hints, and simply spicing up your products.

### Getting Started

Stepping the into world of web animations might seem scary and intimidating at first, but don't worry, we've got you. Our platform was designed and engineered to make the experience a pleasant and intuitive one.

You can find the Animax documentation on [here](https://github.com/zuri-training/anima_lib_team98/blob/develop/DOCUMENTATION.md).

### Features 

- Normal language: The name of the animations are very close to normal human language, and user do not need to write any code at all.

- Ease of Styling: Animax.css contains a set of CSS selectors like `bounce-1x` and `move-up` that makes it easy to animate your HTML elements by passing the relevant ID or class.Easily export code for iOS (Swift), Web (HTML/CSS/JS) or SVG and watch your design comes to life.
- Light and user-friendly: The library was built using plain CSS, and no use of external libraries that might reduce your project's performance.
- Production-ready animation library: Less coding, and more producing. Animax is an animation library that’s built for production. It support all major web browsers.

## Usage Examples

1. Download the library.
2. Extract the zipped file.
3. Import the library into your project using the `link` tag. 
   
   ```html
   <html>
   <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="animax.css">
    
    <title>Home</title>
   </head>
   <body>
   
    ........

    <script src="animax.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

4. Add the animation ID, which is `bounce-1x` in this instance, to the HTML element you would like to animate.
   ```html
   <body>
   
    ........
 
   
   <div id="bounce-1x"></div>

    ........

   </body>
   ```

5. Voila, the element is automatically animated.
